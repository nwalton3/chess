# Ideas

- Show notation as you play
- Rewind to any point
- Start a new game from any point in a previous game
- Importing of games in algebraic notation
- Turn on or off 
  - helps for where pieces can move
  - flip board for each turn (to play on upright or tabletop screen)
- Board fills the most vertical and horizontal space
- Saved games (user accounts)
- Classic games to review
- Recognize openings and, in tutorial mode, give pointers to both sides on traditional/appropriate play of that opening
